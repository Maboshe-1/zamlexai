Generate a clean, professional Non‑Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) between {{party_a}} (“Disclosing Party”) and {{party_b}} (“Receiving Party”):

1. **Effective Date**  
   The Effective Date of this Agreement is {{effective_date}}.  
   Risk: Ensure the date aligns with commercial timelines; otherwise confidentiality may lapse prematurely.

2. **Definitions**  
   2.1 “Confidential Information” means all non‑public, proprietary, or sensitive information, whether oral, written, electronic, or tangible, disclosed by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party.  
   Risk: Over‑broad definitions can unintentionally capture non‑sensitive data.

3. **Obligations of Receiving Party**  
   3.1 Maintain Confidential Information in strict confidence.  
   3.2 Use it solely for evaluation of potential business transactions.  
   3.3 Not disclose to any third party without prior written consent.  
   Risk: Omitting a “no reverse engineering” clause may allow de‑facto IP discovery.

4. **Exclusions**  
   Confidential Information does not include information that:  
   a) Is or becomes publicly available without breach;  
   b) Was known to Receiving Party before disclosure;  
   c) Is independently developed;  
   d) Is rightfully received from a third party under no obligation of confidentiality.  
   {% if exclusions %}  
   Additional Exclusions: {{exclusions}}  
   {% endif %}  
   Risk: Too‑narrow exclusions can trap routine know‑how as confidential.

5. **Term and Termination**  
   This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for {{term}} unless earlier terminated by mutual written agreement.  
   Upon termination, Receiving Party shall return or destroy all Confidential Information.  
   Risk: Failure to require certification of destruction may leave data lingering.

6. **No License**  
   Nothing herein grants any license under any patent, trademark, or copyright.  
   Risk: Lack of clarity on IP ownership can lead to downstream disputes.

7. **Remedies**  
   Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized disclosure may cause irreparable harm.  
   Disclosing Party may seek injunctive relief in addition to damages.  
   Risk: Not requiring arbitration may expose parties to costly litigation.

8. **Governing Law & Jurisdiction**  
   This Agreement is governed by the laws of [Jurisdiction].  
   Any dispute shall be resolved exclusively in the courts of [Location].  
   Risk: Specifying multiple jurisdictions can render venue clauses unenforceable.

9. **Miscellaneous**  
   9.1 Entire Agreement.  
   9.2 Amendments only by written instrument signed by both parties.  
   9.3 Severability.  
   9.4 Assignment prohibited without prior consent.  
   Risk: Omitting an “assignment” clause can allow unwanted transfer of rights.
